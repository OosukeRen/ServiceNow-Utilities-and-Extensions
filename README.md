# ServiceNow-Utilities-and-Extensions
A bunch of utilities for ServiceNow Developers. Since I don't have access to the same VSCode marketplace profile I had used previously for the Tables Intellisense extension, but still have the source code, even with more features implemented, I'll be open sourcing it soon in the future.

## Existing extensions and utilities so far

- [Intellisense CLI](/IntellisenseCLI/README.md) 


## To be published: 

- Source Code for [My VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OosukeRen.servicenow-tables-intellisense)

- Localhost html map of all tables and fields, integration with the extension so that if you rightclick on a table name you get redirected to the map of the table to see all its fields, and etc.

- Node.js module for ServiceNow Queries with support for the preexisting intellisens

- Update for the extension for support for intellisense for ALL instance scopes, and their script includes, eventually with support for documentation(so that you even get any comments for any methods under them too).

- Support for intellisense for Business Rules, Notifications and others based on the table of their current record.

- Considerations for merging with the preexisting official extension of ServiceNow so as to fix the existing issue with the necessity of older VSCode (version <= 1.82.3)
